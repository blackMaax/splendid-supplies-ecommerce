# Vercel Blob Setup Guide

## âœ… **What's Been Implemented:**

1. **Vercel Blob Integration**: Images now upload to Vercel's cloud storage in production
2. **Local Development**: Still uses local file storage for development
3. **Image Deletion**: You can delete uploaded images from the admin panel
4. **Automatic Detection**: The system automatically uses the right storage method

## ðŸ”§ **Setup Required:**

### Step 1: Enable Vercel Blob in Your Project

1. Go to your Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `splendid-supplies-ecommerce`
3. Go to **Storage** tab
4. Click **Create Database** â†’ **Blob**
5. Choose a name (e.g., "product-images")
6. Click **Create**

### Step 2: Environment Variables (Automatic)

Vercel will automatically add the required environment variable `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` to your project when you create the Blob store. No manual configuration needed!

## ðŸŽ‰ **How It Works:**

### **In Production (splendidsupplies.shop):**
- âœ… Upload images directly in admin panel
- âœ… Images stored in Vercel Blob (500MB free)
- âœ… Delete images from admin panel
- âœ… Fast CDN delivery worldwide
- âœ… Automatic optimization

### **In Development (localhost):**
- âœ… Upload images to local `/public/uploads/` folder
- âœ… Delete images from local storage
- âœ… Same interface, different storage

## ðŸš€ **Ready to Use:**

Once you've created the Blob store in Vercel (Step 1), your image uploads will work immediately on the live site!

**Test it:**
1. Go to https://www.splendidsupplies.shop/admin
2. Add or edit a product
3. Upload images directly - they'll go to Vercel Blob
4. Delete images using the X button - they'll be removed from Blob

## ðŸ’° **Costs:**
- **Free Tier**: 500 MB storage + 5 GB bandwidth/month
- **After Free**: $0.15/GB storage + $0.40/GB bandwidth
- Perfect for most e-commerce sites!
